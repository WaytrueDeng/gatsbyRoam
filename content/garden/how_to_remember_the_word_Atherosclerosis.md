The word "atherosclerosis" is derived from two Greek words: "athero," which means gruel or paste, and "sclerosis," which means hardening. The term was first used in medical literature in the early 20th century to describe the pathological process of hardening and thickening of the arterial walls that is characteristic of atherosclerosis. The term was coined by the Austrian pathologist Felix Marchand in 1904, who used it to describe the formation of plaques in the arterial walls that were composed of cholesterol and other lipids. Today, atherosclerosis is recognized as a complex disease with multiple causes and risk factors, and it remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
